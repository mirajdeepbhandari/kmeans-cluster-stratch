  <h1>K-Means Clustering From Scratch</h1>


  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This project demonstrates implementation of the KMeans clustering algorithm using Python. KMeans is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for grouping similar data points into clusters.</p>

  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Clone the Repository</strong>: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
      <pre><code>git clone &lt;repository_url&gt;</code></pre></li>
    <li><strong>Install Dependencies</strong>: Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:
      <pre><code>pip install matplotlib pandas numpy</code></pre></li>
    <li><strong>Run the Code</strong>: Execute the Python script named <code>app.py</code> to see the KMeans clustering in action. Make sure you have the 'cluster.csv' file in the same directory as the script.</li>
  </ol>



  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>You can modify and extend this code for your own data and experiments. Here are a few things you might consider doing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use different datasets to see how the KMeans algorithm behaves with various types of data.</li>
    <li>Experiment with different values for the number of clusters (<code>n_clusters</code>) and maximum iterations (<code>max_iter</code>) in the <code>KMeans</code> class.</li>
    <li>Refactor the code to improve performance, add more features, or make it more flexible.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Remember to properly attribute the source if you plan to use this code as part of your own projects.</p>

  <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
  <p>This project was inspired by the need to understand and visualize data clustering using the KMeans algorithm. The custom <code>KMeans</code> class is a simplified version for educational purposes and may not be optimized for all scenarios.</p>
